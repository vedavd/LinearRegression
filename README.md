> BoomBike Sharing Assignment.
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. Business Goal: You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- Holiday Indicates whether a day is a holiday, affecting demand due to changes in routine.
- Temperature (temp) Affects comfort levels for outdoor activities like biking.
- Humidity (hum) Can influence biking conditions and demand.
- Windspeed Higher windspeeds might deter bike usage due to increased effort required.
- Season Seasonal changes significantly impact biking preferences and demand.
- Months (January, July, September, November, December) Specific months may see variations in demand due to weather conditions, holidays, and other seasonal factors.
- Year Year-over-year growth or decline in bike-sharing usage could indicate trends.
- Sunday Weekends, particularly Sundays, might have different demand patterns compared to weekdays.
- Weather Situation (Light Snow, Mist + Cloud): Adverse weather conditions can significantly reduce the demand for bike- sharing. Understanding these variables allows for better prediction and management of bike-sharing demand, enabling targeted strategies for marketing, fleet management, and service provision.
